Of course. Based on your vision and the existing codebase, here is a detailed, numbered plan to refactor and implement the desired functionality for your in-browser CAD tool.

This plan prioritizes building a robust foundation and then incrementally adding features, addressing your biggest grievances first.

Phase 1: Foundation and Core Functionality

This phase focuses on refactoring the core engine, fixing the broken parts, and implementing the fundamental user interactions as you described.

Step 1: Refactor the Core cadEngine for Stability and Scalability

The current implementation has significant tech debt. This step establishes a clean, reliable foundation to prevent future issues. The goal is to make the cadEngine the single source of truth for all Replicad operations, with the UI exclusively reacting to state changes.

lib/cadEngine.ts:

Isolate Replicad Objects: Modify the ReplicadShape interface and the shapes Map. Instead of storing the full replicadSolid object in the application's state (which is not serializable and causes issues), the engine will maintain an internal map of id -> replicadObject.

The shape data stored in the global state (cadStore) will only contain the parameters needed to recreate the shape (e.g., { type: 'box', width: 10, height: 10, depth: 10 }).

Implement a regenerateShape(id) method in the engine that can rebuild a Replicad object from its stored parameters. This is crucial for undo/redo and state hydration.

Refine all methods (createBox, unionShapes, etc.) to return a serializable object containing the new shape's ID, parameters, and its calculated mesh for rendering. The live Replicad object will only live inside the engine.

stores/cadStore.ts:

Modify the CADObject type in types/cad.ts to remove the solid and sketch properties.

The cadSceneAtom will now store a "lightweight" representation of the scene. The CADViewport will be responsible for getting the renderable mesh from the cadEngine using an object's ID.

lib/cadUtils.ts:

Reinforce this file as the primary API for the UI. All tool palette and component interactions will call functions in CADUtils, which in turn will orchestrate calls to the cadEngine and update the state via Jotai atoms. This creates a clean separation of concerns.

Step 2: Implement Robust Primitive Creation

This step ensures the most basic functionality is reliable and follows the new, stable architecture.

components/ToolPalette.tsx:

Modify the onClick handlers for the Box, Cylinder, and Sphere buttons.

These handlers will now open a modal (reusing your existing modal logic) to get dimensions (e.g., radius, height).

On confirm, they will call a corresponding function in cadUtils, such as CADUtils.createCylinder({ radius: 10, height: 20 }).

lib/cadUtils.ts:

Create new functions: createBox(params), createCylinder(params), createSphere(params).

These functions will call the cadEngine to generate the shape and its mesh.

Upon receiving the result from the engine, they will use the addObjectAtom to add the new, serializable object to the global state.

lib/cadEngine.ts:

The createBox, createCylinder, and createSphere methods will perform the actual replicad.makeBox(...) calls.

After creating the Replicad object, they will compute its mesh using convertToMesh, store the live object in the engine's internal map, and return the serializable shape data and mesh to cadUtils.

Step 3: Implement Face & Edge Selection in the Viewport

This is a critical prerequisite for all advanced actions. It enables the user to interact with sub-elements of a shape.

components/CADViewport.tsx:

Implement raycasting on mouse clicks to detect intersections with object meshes.

When an intersection is found, you get the faceIndex, point of intersection, and the face's normal.

Create a new utility function findReplicadFace(objectId, point, normal) in cadEngine.ts. This function will use the intersection data to query the underlying Replicad object and identify the specific face that was clicked. This is the bridge between the visual mesh and the logical CAD data.

Similarly, implement logic to detect and select edges. When the mouse is near an edge, you can find the two adjacent faces and use Replicad's finders to identify the common edge.

Add visual feedback (highlighting) for the selected face or edge. This can be done by rendering a semi-transparent mesh of just the selected face/edge on top of the original object.

stores/cadStore.ts:

Introduce a new atom, selectionAtom, to store the current selection state, which can now be an object, a face, or an edge.

Example type: type Selection = { type: 'object', id: string } | { type: 'face', objectId: string, faceId: any } | { type: 'edge', objectId: string, edgeId: any };

types/cad.ts:

Define the new Selection type.

Step 4: Implement "Draw on Face" Workflow

This implements the core of your proposed user experience for creating new features on existing solids.

components/ToolPalette.tsx:

Create a new "Start Sketch" tool (Pencil icon). This tool becomes enabled only when a single face is selected.

Clicking it will set a new global state, e.g., isSketchingAtom, to true.

page.tsx:

When isSketchingAtom is true, the UI should change to "Sketch Mode". The main toolbar could be replaced by a 2D drawing toolbar (Line, Circle, Rectangle), and a "Finish Sketch" button should appear.

components/CADViewport.tsx:

When entering "Sketch Mode", use the selected face's plane data (from the cadEngine) to smoothly transition the camera (OrbitControls) to a 2D orthographic view where the face is flat and facing the user. Replicad's lookFromPlane is a good reference.

In this mode, mouse interactions should be mapped to the 2D plane of the face. Clicks will generate 2D points for the sketch.

Use the sketchEngine to manage the creation of 2D geometry (lines, circles). The viewport will render a preview of these sketch lines.

lib/sketchEngine.ts:

Enhance this class to handle the state of an active 2D sketch, including its geometry and constraints.

When "Finish Sketch" is clicked, the sketchEngine finalizes the drawing and stores it in a way that can be used for the next operation (e.g., Extrude Cut).

Phase 2: Advanced Operations and User Power-Features

With a solid foundation, we can now build the more complex and powerful features.

Step 5: Implement Core Modification Actions (Extrude Cut & Fillet/Chamfer)

This step delivers the first "advanced actions" that operate on the selections made in Phase 1.

components/ToolPalette.tsx:

Enable the "Extrude" button when a completed sketch is selected. Enable "Fillet" and "Chamfer" buttons when edges are selected.

Clicking these buttons will open a modal to get the required parameters (e.g., depth for extrude, radius for fillet).

lib/cadUtils.ts:

Add new functions: extrudeFromSketch(sketchId, depth, operationType: 'add' | 'cut'), filletEdges(selection, radius), chamferEdges(selection, distance).

lib/cadEngine.ts:

Extrude: The engine will take the sketch, extrude it to create a new solid, and then perform a cut (or fuse) operation against the sketch's parent object. It will then replace the old object with the newly modified one in its internal state map and return the new shape's data.

Fillet/Chamfer: The engine will use the edge selection data to create a Replicad EdgeFinder function. A common way is to find the edge that containsPoint(point), where point was a point on the edge stored during selection. It will then call .fillet(radius, finder) on the Replicad object and update the scene.

Step 6: Implement Direct Drawing & Extrusion on a Work Plane

This fulfills your next major goal of creating custom shapes from scratch without needing a primitive first.

components/ToolPalette.tsx:

The "Start Sketch" tool will now also be enabled when nothing is selected.

Workflow:

User clicks "Start Sketch" with no selection.

The app prompts the user to select a work plane (XY, XZ, YZ) via a simple modal.

The app enters "Sketch Mode" (same as Step 4), but on the chosen global work plane.

The user draws a 2D shape and clicks "Finish Sketch".

The user then clicks the "Extrude" tool.

A modal asks for the extrusion height.

A new solid object is created in the scene.

File Changes:

The logic in CADViewport.tsx and ToolPalette.tsx from Step 4 will be reused and adapted to handle this case.

cadEngine.ts will need a method like extrudeNewSolid(sketchId, height) that creates a new object instead of modifying an existing one.

Step 7: (Optional but Recommended) Implement Code Editor View

This feature provides immense value for debugging, learning, and power users. It can be implemented in parallel or after the core features are stable.

page.tsx:

Add a toggle button to switch between "Visual Editor" and "Code Editor" modes.

Create components/CodeEditor.tsx:

This component will use @monaco-editor/react.

When the component mounts, it will need a function in cadEngine to generate the Replicad JavaScript code that represents the current scene.

cadEngine.ts will need a new method generateCode(). This method iterates through its internal map of shapes and their parameters, building a string of JavaScript code.

When the user edits the code in Monaco, a "Run" button will send the new code to the cadEngine.

lib/cadEngine.ts:

Implement executeCode(code: string). This method will use a new Function() constructor or a similar sandboxed execution method to run the user's Replicad code. It must clear the existing scene and then populate it with the new objects generated by the code. This is a complex but powerful feature.

By following this plan, you will systematically eliminate tech debt, build a stable and extensible architecture, and deliver the core features of your vision in a logical order.

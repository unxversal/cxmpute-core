# CXPT Tokenomics

## Overview

CXPT (Cxmpute Token) is the native utility token powering the Cxmpute ecosystem. It facilitates compute resource allocation, rewards distribution, and platform governance.

## Token Distribution

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 CXPT

| Category | Percentage | Amount | Vesting Period |
|----------|------------|---------|----------------|
| Founding Team | 30% | 300,000,000 | 4 years, 1 year cliff |
| Community | 48% | 480,000,000 | Released over 5 years |
| Treasury | 15% | 150,000,000 | Controlled by governance |
| DEX/CEX Liquidity | 7% | 70,000,000 | Released over 2 years |

## Token Utility

### 1. Compute Resource Allocation
- Users pay for compute resources in CXPT
- Two pricing models:
  - Subscription-based (monthly CXPT payments)
  - Usage-based (pay-per-compute)

### 2. Provider Rewards
- Providers earn CXPT for providing compute resources
- Rewards distributed based on:
  - Compute power provided
  - Uptime and reliability
  - Service quality metrics

### 3. Governance
- Token holders can participate in platform governance
- Vote on protocol parameters
- Propose and vote on platform upgrades

## Pricing Models

### Subscription Model
- Monthly CXPT payments
- Tiered subscription levels
- Unused compute rolls over (up to 50%)
- Priority access during high demand

### Usage-Based Model
- Pay-per-compute in CXPT
- Dynamic pricing based on:
  - Network demand
  - Compute resource type
  - Provider availability

## Reward Distribution

### Provider Rewards
1. **Base Rewards**
   - Points system converted to CXPT
   - Based on compute power provided
   - Adjusted by performance multipliers

2. **Performance Multipliers**
   - Uptime: 0.8x - 1.2x
   - Response Time: 0.9x - 1.1x
   - Network Demand: 0.5x - 2.0x

### User Rewards
1. **Referral Program**
   - Earn CXPT for referring new users
   - Tiered reward structure

2. **Loyalty Program**
   - Long-term user rewards
   - Usage-based bonuses

## Token Economics

### Supply Mechanics
- Fixed total supply
- No additional minting
- Burn mechanism for fee collection

### Fee Structure
1. **Transaction Fees**
   - 0.1% per transaction
   - 50% burned
   - 50% to treasury

2. **Protocol Fees**
   - 2% of compute costs
   - Distributed to:
     - Protocol (40%)
     - Providers (40%)
     - Users (20%)

### Value Accrual
1. **Token Burns**
   - Regular burns from fees
   - Deflationary pressure

2. **Staking Rewards**
   - Earn rewards for staking
   - Enhanced platform benefits

## Governance

### Voting Power
- 1 CXPT = 1 vote
- Minimum stake for proposals
- Delegation allowed

### Governance Parameters
- Fee adjustments
- Reward distribution
- Protocol upgrades
- Treasury management

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Testnet
- Free usage
- Points accumulation
- No real token value

### Phase 2: Mainnet Launch
- Token generation
- Initial distribution
- Basic functionality

### Phase 3: Full Implementation
- Complete token utility
- Governance activation
- Advanced features

## Risk Management

### Market Risks
- Price volatility
- Liquidity management
- Market manipulation

### Protocol Risks
- Smart contract security
- Governance attacks
- Economic attacks

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Token distribution
- Usage patterns
- Reward distribution
- Burn rates

### Reporting
- Monthly token reports
- Quarterly audits
- Annual reviews

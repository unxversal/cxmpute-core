# CXPT Tokenomics

## Overview

CXPT (Cxmpute Token) is the utility token powering the Cxmpute platform. The platform uses CXPT to facilitate compute resource allocation and provider rewards, with a focus on efficient resource distribution and platform sustainability.

## Token Distribution

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 CXPT

| Category | Percentage | Amount | Vesting Period |
|----------|------------|---------|----------------|
| Platform Reserve | 30% | 300,000,000 | Controlled by admin |
| Provider Rewards | 48% | 480,000,000 | Released based on admin schedule |
| Platform Operations | 15% | 150,000,000 | Controlled by admin |
| Market Liquidity | 7% | 70,000,000 | Managed by admin |

## Token Utility

### 1. Compute Resource Allocation
- Users pay for compute resources in CXPT
- Two pricing models:
  - Subscription-based (monthly CXPT payments)
  - Usage-based (pay-per-compute)

### 2. Provider Rewards
- Providers earn CXPT for providing compute resources
- Rewards distributed based on:
  - Compute power provided
  - Uptime and reliability
  - Service quality metrics
  - Admin-determined reward structure

## Pricing Models

### Subscription Model
- Monthly CXPT payments
- Tiered subscription levels
- Unused compute rolls over (up to 50%)
- Priority access during high demand

### Usage-Based Model
- Pay-per-compute in CXPT
- Dynamic pricing based on:
  - Network demand
  - Compute resource type
  - Provider availability

## Credit System

### Vault Management
1. **Credit Tracking**
   - Loaded Credits: Total credits deposited by users
   - Spent Credits: Credits consumed for compute resources
   - Protocol Balance: Admin-determined split from total revenue

2. **Credit Flow**
   - All payments (subscription/usage) go to vault
   - Admin determines split between:
     - Provider rewards
     - Protocol revenue
     - Platform operations

### Reward Distribution

#### Provider Rewards
1. **Base Rewards**
   - Points system converted to CXPT
   - Based on compute power provided
   - Adjusted by performance multipliers

2. **Performance Multipliers**
   - Uptime: 0.8x - 1.2x
   - Response Time: 0.9x - 1.1x
   - Network Demand: 0.5x - 2.0x

#### User Rewards
1. **Referral Program**
   - Earn CXPT for referring new users
   - Tiered reward structure

2. **Loyalty Program**
   - Long-term user rewards
   - Usage-based bonuses

## Token Economics

### Supply Mechanics
- Fixed total supply
- No additional minting
- Burn mechanism for fee collection

### Fee Structure

#### Compute Service Pricing

Compute services are priced based on service tiers and usage:

| Tier | Price per 1K Tokens (Input/Output) |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| **Tide Pool** | $0.0002 / $0.0004 |
| **Blue Surge** | $0.0005 / $0.0010 |
| **Open Ocean** | $0.0015 / $0.0030 |
| **Mariana Depth** | $0.0040 / $0.0080 |

#### Specialized Services

| Service | Unit | Price |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Text-to-Speech** | Per minute of audio | $0.015 |
| **Web Scraping** | Per page scraped | $0.001 |
| **Embeddings** | Per 1K tokens | $0.0001 |

#### Subscription Plans

| Plan | Monthly Fee | Max Concurrent | Rate Limit (RPM) | Monthly Tokens |
|------|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Starter** | $19 | 1 request | 20 RPM | 2M tokens |
| **Professional** | $79 | 3 requests | 100 RPM | 8M tokens |
| **Scale** | $299 | 8 requests | 500 RPM | 40M tokens |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | 20+ requests | 2000+ RPM | 200M+ tokens |

#### Revenue Distribution

All revenue from compute services is distributed according to admin-determined ratios between:
- Protocol revenue
- Provider rewards
- Platform operations

### Value Accrual
1. **Token Burns**
   - Regular burns from fees
   - Deflationary pressure

2. **Future Staking**
   - Potential future feature
   - Not currently implemented

## Platform Administration

### Admin Controls
- Reward distribution parameters
- Fee structures
- Platform parameters
- Emergency controls

### Revenue Management
- Protocol revenue allocation
- Provider reward distribution
- Platform operations funding
- Market operations

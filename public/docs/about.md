# About Cxmpute

Cxmpute is a distributed AI/Compute services platform that connects users who need AI services with providers who offer compute resources, creating a global network of AI compute power.

## Our Mission

We're building the future of AI infrastructure by democratizing access to compute resources and creating new income opportunities for hardware owners worldwide.

### The Problem We Solve

- **High AI Costs**: Traditional cloud providers charge premium rates for AI services
- **Limited Access**: Many developers can't afford enterprise-grade AI infrastructure
- **Wasted Resources**: Millions of powerful computers sit idle while AI demand grows
- **Centralization**: AI compute is concentrated in a few major cloud providers

### Our Solution

Cxmpute creates a **decentralized marketplace** where:
- **Users** get affordable, high-quality AI services
- **Providers** monetize their idle hardware
- **Everyone** benefits from a more distributed, resilient AI infrastructure

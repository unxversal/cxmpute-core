# Rewards & Referrals

Boost your earnings and help grow the Cxmpute network through our referral system! Whether you're a user or provider, you can earn more points by inviting others to join.

## How Rewards Work

### Points-Based Economy

Cxmpute operates on a **points-based reward system** where:

- **Users** earn points for API usage and activity
- **Providers** earn points for serving requests and maintaining uptime
- **Everyone** earns additional points through successful referrals

At the end of each **epoch** (usually monthly), points are converted to actual rewards based on platform revenue.

### Testnet Phase Benefits

üéâ **During our testnet phase:**
- All services are completely **free**
- You still earn points for future rewards
- Referral bonuses are active and accumulating
- Early participants get bonus multipliers

## Referral System

1. **Refer new users** who start using Cxmpute services

### Your Referral Benefits

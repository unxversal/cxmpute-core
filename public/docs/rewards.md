4. Referral bonuses distributed up the chain automatically

## Multi-Level Referral System

### How It Works

When you refer someone, you earn from their activity **and** from anyone they refer:

```
You (Level 0)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Direct Referral (Level 1) ‚Üí You earn 10-15% of their earnings
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Secondary Referral (Level 2) ‚Üí You earn 5-8% of their earnings
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tertiary Referral (Level 3) ‚Üí You earn 2.5-4% of their earnings
```

### Automatic Processing

Every time someone earns rewards:
1. **Primary referrer** gets their percentage
2. **Secondary referrer** gets their percentage  
3. **Tertiary referrer** gets their percentage
4. **Original earner** keeps 100% of their earnings
5. All processed automatically in real-time

# Sliding-Window Task Tracker

> A living document that always shows only the *current* working plan and the last few steps we just accomplished.  Edit this file – don't create new docs – so it acts like a sliding window over the project's progress. make sure you're also referencing plan.md for the details.

## 🎉 **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED** - All Core Phases Complete!

### ✅ ALL PHASES COMPLETED
1. **PHASE 1** – Foundation & Core Functionality ✅ 
2. **PHASE 2** – Advanced Operations & Power Features ✅
3. **PHASE 3** – Sketch Mode Implementation ✅
4. **PHASE 4** – Extrude/Cut Operations ✅
5. **PHASE 5** – Edge Operations (Fillet/Chamfer) ✅
6. **PHASE 6** – Reference Plane Sketching ✅
7. **PHASE 7** – Code Editor Toggle ✅

## 🚀 Latest Completed Implementation (Phase 4-7)

### **PHASE 4** – Enhanced Extrude with Cut/Add Toggle ✅
- ✅ Added sophisticated extrude modal with operation selection
- ✅ Cut vs Add toggle with visual differentiation (red for cut, green for add)
- ✅ Proper integration with cadUtils API and error handling

### **PHASE 6** – Reference Plane Sketching ✅
- ✅ Plane selection modal (XY/XZ/YZ) when no face selected
- ✅ "Start Sketch" button enabled for both face selection AND empty selection
- ✅ Beautiful plane selection UI with visual icons and descriptions
- ✅ Complete workflow: empty selection → choose plane → sketch → extrude

### **PHASE 7** – Code Editor Toggle ✅
- ✅ Monaco Editor integration with TypeScript/JavaScript support
- ✅ Toggle button in header (Code/Visual modes)
- ✅ Full Replicad API type definitions and autocomplete
- ✅ `executeCode()` and `generateCode()` methods in CADEngine
- ✅ Code execution with sandboxed environment
- ✅ Generate code from current scene functionality
- ✅ Save/load/reset code features

## 🏆 **Current State - Fully Functional CAD Tool**

**✅ Complete Feature Set:**
- Robust primitive creation (Box, Cylinder, Sphere, Cone) with modal inputs
- Face/Edge/Object selection with visual feedback
- Complete sketch mode with 2D drawing tools and face/plane sketching
- Advanced boolean operations (Union/Subtract/Intersect)
- Extrude operations with cut/add toggle
- Fillet/Chamfer edge operations
- Reference plane sketching (XY/XZ/YZ)
- Full code editor with Monaco and Replicad API
- Proper error handling and user feedback throughout

**🎯 Architecture Highlights:**
- Clean separation: CADEngine (core) → cadUtils (API) → UI components
- Jotai state management with proper atom organization
- Internal Replicad object management with lightweight frontend state
- TypeScript throughout with comprehensive type safety
- Modular component architecture with proper styling

**🔧 Technical Implementation:**
- Three.js/React Three Fiber for 3D rendering
- Monaco Editor for code editing with TypeScript support
- Replicad WebAssembly library for CAD operations
- Sonner for toast notifications
- Comprehensive modal system for user inputs

## 🎯 **Optional Future Enhancements** (Beyond Core Requirements)
- Advanced constraint-based sketching
- Assembly features and multi-part models
- Import/Export additional file formats
- Parametric modeling with history tree
- Advanced rendering and materials
- Collaborative features

**Current Status: ✅ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED - All core CAD functionality implemented!**
